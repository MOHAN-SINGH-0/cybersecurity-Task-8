## What is a VPN?
A **Virtual Private Network (VPN)** routes your internet traffic through an encrypted tunnel to a remote server, hiding your real IP address and protecting your data.

### Benefits:
- Masks your IP to protect your identity
- Secures data on public Wi-Fi
- Helps bypass region-blocked content
- Prevents websites and ISPs from tracking your activity

### Limitations:
- Free VPNs may have limited speeds and fewer servers
- VPNs don’t prevent phishing or malware
- Using browser-based VPNs only protects browser traffic (not entire system)

## Summary

VPN encryption ensures that your internet data is private and secure by routing it through an encrypted tunnel. With strong protocols, IP masking, and DNS protection, VPNs play a critical role in maintaining online privacy — especially on public networks or in restricted environments.
